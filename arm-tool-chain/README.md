# ARM Tool Chain Development Container

This devcontainer contains:
- `arm-none-eabi` version (GCC 13.2) 13.2.Rel1 (October 30, 2023)
- `make` 



Extra note: Might be possible to connect a (STLink SWD) Debugger to the container to upload from the container itself. For Windows, will need to use **usbipd-win** to connect the debugger to the container. Check the `platformio_devcontainer` for inspiration.
